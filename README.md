# ideagator

The ideas behind ideagator are the following: 

1) BRIDGES
Productive creativity creates useful and unexpected connections between things, often in an uncommon, unique and apparently new ways. 
Forced association involves making bridges between ideas to solve a defined problem.

2) QUANTITY LEADS TO QUALITY
A higher volume of ideas means a higher volume of options. A higher volume of intentionally generated options implies a higher likelihood that one option will be in the 20% that is most useful (See the Pareto principle).

3) MATRIXING IDEAS
An aggressive brainstorming technique is to take a handful of words and idea fragments and systematically combine each concept. By exploring every possible combination of ideas, more ideas are generated and the concepts are more thoroughly explored than working in other ways.

4) TIME BOXES
Many creative methods recommend setting time limits to generate a lot of ideas quickly. Crazy Eights. McNair Wilson in Hatch talks about it. In a controlled game environment, one could spend 20 seconds or a minute per idea-combination and quickly iterate through a lot of ideas, handling each combination as a writing or sketch-prompt. 

5) PROBLEM DEFINITION
A better defined problem is more easy to find relevant solutions for. Defining a problem in terms of limitations: time, space, medium helps to limit the options to a manageable playing field.At its most basic, there needs to be a way to clearly record the goal. Going deeper, there could be some other tools to help define the problem at hand.
