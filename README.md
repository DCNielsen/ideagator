IdeaGator is a tool for brute force idea generation. 

Often ideas are arrived at directly from reference, research, experience and intuition. This is a practical way to arrive at an answer. This method introduces a lot of limitations and filters early on, which may make it easier to zero in on a useful answer. Fewer ideas result, but the ones that do are directly tailored to the problem. A drawback to this method is that too many filters, or the wrong filters can kill off worlds of useful ideas early on.

IdeaGator instead emphasizes lateral thinking. Play and volume of exploration are emphasized more than definition. The idea is to set up a playground for idea generation, and to leave concerns of usefulness at the back of our mind to discover lots of wild ideas. This way, a broader variety of exciting, unexpected and equally useful ideas may emerge. Once a sea of ideas emerges, Filtering becomes the chief task for reining in the chaos to something useful.


1) GENERATE LISTS
Brainstorming can often begin by free-association. The kind of content that fills up whiteboards and sketchbook pages ranges from fairly complete answers to the creative problem, down to things that are very lateral or distant from the starting point. Brainstorm content may be a full, rich, thematic solution. Or maybe it's just an idea step. Or it might be word-cloud fragments related to the idea, down to smaller fragments intentionally pulled out of larger ones. A list item might be completely random and intentionally detached from the problem at hand, to break out of a pattern or rut.

2) BRIDGES
Productive creativity creates useful and unexpected connections between things, often in an uncommon, unique and apparently new ways. 
Forced association involves making bridges between ideas to solve a defined problem.

3) QUANTITY LEADS TO QUALITY
A higher volume of ideas means a higher volume of options. A higher volume of intentionally generated options implies a higher likelihood that one option will be in the 20% that is most useful (See the Pareto principle).

4) MATRIXING IDEAS
An aggressive "brute force" brainstorming technique is to take a handful of words and idea fragments and systematically combine each concept. By exploring every possible combination of ideas, more ideas are generated and the concepts are more thoroughly explored than working in other ways.

5) TIME BOXES
Setting time limits is a way to "gamify" a process and turn it into fun challenge. In a controlled environment, each combination of words can be converted into a writing or sketch-prompt. At 20 seconds or a minute per idea-combination, one could rapidly iterate through a lot of ideas. 

6) PROBLEM DEFINITION
A better defined problem is more easy to find relevant solutions for. Defining a problem in terms of limitations: time, space, medium helps to limit the options to a manageable playing field.At its most basic, there needs to be a way to clearly record the goal. Going deeper, there could be some other tools to help define the problem at hand.
